This repository contains the code for our teams capstone project, for which we participated in a Kaggle competition [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability] to predict default risk for home loan applicants. 

The file Credit_risk_MADS_team_4_capstone.ipynb contains our final product, which is a notebook intended to run in Kaggle's contest environment. It contains the steps for loading in the contest data, data processing, training an ensemble of models, and finally generating submissions. See the report for more details, or the poster for an overall summary. Contest regulations prevent us from sharing the data files, so these results might be impossible to replicate after the end of the contest.

A sample of our initial data exploration is contained in exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb. dataset-descriptions.py contains our json descriptions of the contest input files on the kaggle servers, which we passed to our class DataLoader to select specific files and features.
